# checklist

## Todo

### Display
* Let user move cursor over into detailed box if they need to scroll into details (should the description be exceptionally long)
* Should set a certain window size that the program just won't display for

### Actions
* Need to set up what happens in the GUI when performing the following actions: 
  * Add
  * Update
  * Delete
  * Filter (by Tag)
  * Filter (by Completion type)
  * Sort (by Urgency)

## Done

* Creating DB
* Creating config
* Adding to DB (through CLI)
* Listing all tasks from DB
* Wiping DB
* Displaying tasks in the GUI
* Displaying details of a highlighted task
* Making sure text wraps properly
* GUI won't crash if there are no tasks
* Only show slice of tasks that fit within the main window
* Let user be able to "scroll" through those
* Have a bar on the side to show user how many of their tasks they are seeing
* Back to where I was but with Ratatui now
