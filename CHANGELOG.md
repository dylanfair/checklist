# Unreleased changes

`checklist` is now much more robust in reading in a `theme.toml` file, in preparation for any additional theme elements (color vs style) or theme attributes that could be added in future releases.

Fixed the Help Menu text that was overlapping the bottom border.

Pop-ups should now be more consistent across different terminal sizes/layouts now.
